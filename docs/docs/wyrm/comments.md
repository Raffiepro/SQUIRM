# Comments

## One line comments

For writing comments in a Wyrm code, you have to write the `#` character. This will create a comment
for one line:

```
# This is a comment! This code will be ignored by Wyrm
```

## Multiline comments

If you want to write a multiline comment, you have to write `###` to open the multiline comment and when
you are finished you have to write `###` for closing the multiline comment

```
###
This is a multiline comment
All of this text will be ignored by Wyrm
###
